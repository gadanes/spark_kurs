Awesome — let’s flesh this out into a **detailed 2-hour PySpark training** with precise timings, learning objectives, suggested exercises, and some practical tips. This outline assumes an interactive workshop format using Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 🧠 Target Audience:
- Beginners in data engineering or data science
- Python-savvy but new to distributed computing
- Comfortable with pandas, but new to Spark

---

## 🔥 PySpark Training Outline – Beginner Level (2 Hours)

### **🕐 Total: ~120 minutes (including small breaks)**

---

### **🔹 0. Welcome & Setup (5 mins)**

**Goal:** Get everyone oriented and ready

- What is Spark? Why PySpark?
- Cluster mode vs local mode (brief visual)
- Environment check (Jupyter + PySpark running)

> 👩‍💻 _No hands-on yet; just intro + tool validation_

---

### **🔹 1. Hello PySpark (20 mins)**  
> _“If you can load a CSV, you can Spark.”_

**Key Concepts:**
- `SparkSession` as the entry point
- DataFrame vs RDD (just basics)
- DataFrame lifecycle in Spark
- Cluster awareness (but keep it light)

**Hands-on:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("HelloSpark") \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .getOrCreate()

df = spark.read.csv("data/people.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.show()
df.printSchema()
```

🎯 _Goal: Understand SparkSession and see results quickly_

---

### **🔹 2. Exploring & Transforming Data (30 mins)**  
> _“This is your new pandas — but distributed.”_

**Topics:**
- Selecting columns
- Filtering rows (`filter`, `where`)
- Creating new columns (`withColumn`)
- Conditional logic (`when`, `otherwise`)
- Null handling (`fillna`, `dropna`)

**Hands-on:**
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when

df = df.withColumn("status", when(col("age") >= 18, "adult").otherwise("minor"))
df.select("name", "age", "status").show()
```

🎯 _Goal: Make PySpark DataFrames feel familiar_

---

### **🔹 3. Aggregations & Grouping (25 mins)**  
> _“Big data ≠ big confusion. Grouping is the same.”_

**Topics:**
- `groupBy` + `agg`
- Common aggregations: `count`, `sum`, `avg`
- Sorting & ordering
- (Optional) Window functions (brief demo)

**Hands-on:**
```python
df.groupBy("status").agg({"age": "avg", "id": "count"}).show()
```

🎯 _Goal: Produce summaries like they would in SQL or pandas_

---

### **🔹 4. Reading & Writing Data (20 mins)**  
> _“Moving data in and out — fast and clean.”_

**Topics:**
- Reading CSV, Parquet
- Writing Parquet/CSV
- (Optional) Writing with partitioning
- Introduction to JDBC read/write

**Hands-on:**
```python
df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("output/people_clean.parquet")
```

🎯 _Goal: Teach real-world ingestion/export flows_

---

### **🔹 5. Bonus Topics (Optional or for follow-up)**  
> _“Just enough spark to get dangerous.”_

- UDFs: how and why to use them
- Caching & persistence
- Repartitioning vs coalescing
- Working with timestamps and dates
- Spark SQL (`spark.sql("SELECT * FROM ...")`)

---

### ✅ Wrap-Up (5 mins)

- Recap: What they learned
- Common errors (e.g., when PySpark behaves unexpectedly)
- Q&A
- Share GitHub repo/slides/materials

---

## 📦 Deliverables (I can help you generate)

- ✅ Jupyter notebooks for each section
- ✅ Sample datasets (`CSV`, `Parquet`)
- ✅ Dockerized environment for zero-setup
- ✅ `.env` + `.gitignore` to make things clean
- ✅ Slide deck (if you want a visual narrative)

---

Would you like me to:
- Auto-generate those notebooks?
- Help you package this as a GitHub repo with a README?
- Create a one-click Docker dev setup for students?

Just tell me your audience & constraints (e.g. offline/online, Linux-only, JupyterHub, etc).
